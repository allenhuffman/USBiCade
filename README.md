Work-in-progress code to read USB joystick via USB host shield, and emit iCade key presses.

This README will be written when I have some time.

This was my prototype code that reads a USB joystick (Playstation style) via a USB Host Shield, and then emits USB keyboard keys in iCade format. It allowed me to hook up a fighter style joystick to my an iPad and use it on iCade compatible games.
